All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot,French Radicals and German police-spies.Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents inpower? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism,against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?Two things result from this fact:I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself apower.II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world,publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of theSpectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched thefollowing manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danishlanguages.I. Bourgeois and Proletarians*The history of all hitherto existing society† is the history of class struggles.Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master‡ and journeyman, in aword, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on anuninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionaryreconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of societyinto various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians,knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen,apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not doneaway with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. * By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers ofwage labour. By proletariat, the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, arereduced to selling their labour power in order to live. [Engels, 1888 English edition]† That is, all written history. In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organisation existing previous to recordedhistory, all but unknown. Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land inRussia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history,and, by and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere fromIndia to Ireland. The inner organisation of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, byLewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. Withthe dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonisticclasses. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, secondedition, Stuttgart, 1886. [Engels, 1888 English Edition and 1890 German Edition (with the last sentence omitted)]‡ Guild-master, that is, a full member of a guild, a master within, not a head of a guild. [Engels, 1888 English Edition]15 Manifesto of the Communist PartyOur epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it hassimplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two greathostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other – Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From theseburgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the risingbourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with thecolonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce,to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionaryelement in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds,now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing systemtook its place. The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class;division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labourin each single workshop.Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longersufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place ofmanufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry; the place of the industrial middle class byindustrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved theway. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, tocommunication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry;and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportionthe bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every classhanded down from the Middle Ages.We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course ofdevelopment, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding politicaladvance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed andself-governing association in the medieval commune*: here independent urban republic (as inItaly and Germany); there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in theperiod of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as acounterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, thebourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market,conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executiveof the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the wholebourgeoisie.The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal,idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his“natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked selfinterest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious * This was the name given their urban communities by the townsmen of Italy and France, after they had purchased orconquered their initial rights of self-government from their feudal lords. [Engels, 1890 German edition] “Commune”was the name taken in France by the nascent towns even before they had conquered from their feudal lords and masterslocal self-government and political rights as the “Third Estate.” Generally speaking, for the economical development ofthe bourgeoisie, England is here taken as the typical country, for its political development, France. [Engels, 1888English Edition]16 Manifesto of the Communist Partyfervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotisticalcalculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberlessindefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom – Free Trade. Inone word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked,shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to withreverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science,into its paid wage labourers.The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the familyrelation to a mere money relation.The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the MiddleAges, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothfulindolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has accomplishedwonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it hasconducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production,and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society.Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the firstcondition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production,uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitationdistinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with theirtrain of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed onesbecome antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy isprofaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and hisrelations with his kind.The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entiresurface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexionseverywhere.The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan characterto production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it hasdrawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-establishednational industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by newindustries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, byindustries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from theremotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarterof the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find newwants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the oldlocal and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universalinter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectualcreations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrowmindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and localliteratures, there arises a world literature.The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immenselyfacilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation.The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinesewalls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. Itcompels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compelsthem to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves.In one word, it creates a world after its own image."
